# CodeJamProject2022: Podcast Player for Long Drives

A podcast player fine-tuned to keep you entertained on long drives.

## Inspiration
Boredom and loneliness are major pain points for carriers. They are regularly faced with long trips away from home and away from loved ones and may feel unproductive. Moreover, around 100,000 crashes per year are attributed to falling asleep during long drives.

## What it does
Our app is a podcast player specially designed to keep carriers awake and entertained during the drive. The player automatically sets up a queue based on user preferences and creates a personalized playlist for the time of the drive. The key selling point is that it randomly plays alerts, jokes (from the famous 123leaderboard blog) and other messages between the playlist to remind the carriers to stay alert.

## How we built it
The app was built using python, listen now API and PyQt6.

## Challenges we ran into
Using a free API that allows limited calls.

## What's next for Podcast Player for Long Drives
We would like to add a location feature to the alert prompts so that it would incentivize the drivers to turn on their location. We would also like to improve our GUI and add more interactive features such as drive updates, trivia, and extend to more than just podcasts.
